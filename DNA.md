# Introduction ![DNA](images/icon.png)
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid carries genetic instruction in all organisms. This molecule can be extracted from the cells of organisms (Strawberry, for example) with a few household chemicals.

# Theory ![DNA](images/icon2.png)
DNA is complexed with proteins and protected from the outside by the lipid membrane of the cell (and/or nucleus). To break down these barriers we can make use of common household compounds and basic chemistry.
Strawberries have a high DNA content (octoploid DNA) which makes them ideal for this application. The

# Steps ![DNA](images/icon.png)
## 1. Homogenization of Strawberry Tissue
* Slice the off the stem of the strawberry and place it into the plastic bag and seal.
* With you hands mash the strawberry into a uniform pulp.

## 2. Making Extraction Solution
* In the 250 mL or greater container add the following
-12.5 mL of dishsoap (~3/4 tablespoons)
-15 g of salt (~1/2 tablespoons)
-Water to 250 mL (~1 cups)
* Mix until salt has dissolved

## 3. Breakdown Cell Components with Extraction Solution
* To the plastic bag containing the mashed strawberry add 10 mL (~3/4 tablespoon) of extraction buffer.
* Continue homogenizing for 2 to 3 more minutes.

## 4. Collecting DNA Solution
* Place the coffee filter over the mouth of a cup and secure with a rubber band (see image below).

* Pour strawberry mash into the filter and allow the liquid to strain through the filter. This liquid contains the DNA.
* Dispose of the filter and strawberry mash.

## 4. Precipitating the DNA with Alcohol
* Slowly add 20 mL (~1.5 tablespoons) of ice-cold isopropyl alcohol to the DNA solution.
* Continue homogenizing for 2 to 3 more minutes.
* Allow to sit for a minute, a white precipitate should form at the interface of the two liquids. This is the DNA.

## 4. Collect the DNA
