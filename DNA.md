# Introduction ![DNA](images/icon.png)
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid carries genetic instruction in all organisms. This molecule can be extracted from the cells of organisms (Strawberry, for example) with a few household chemicals.

# Theory ![DNA](images/icon.png)
DNA is complexed with proteins and protected from the outside by the lipid membrane of the cell (and/or nucleus). To break down these barriers we can make use of common household compounds and basic chemistry.
Strawberries have a high DNA content (octoploid DNA) which makes them ideal for this application. The

# Steps ![DNA](images/icon.png)
## 1. Homogenization of Strawberry Tissue
* Slice the off the stem of the strawberry and place it into the plastic bag and seal.
* With you hands mash the strawberry into a uniform pulp.

## 2. Making Extraction Solution
* In a cup measure out equal parts water
